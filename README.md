Traffic Usage Calculator

This module is developed for an Internet service provider to monitor the customer usage patterns. Customers are able to monitor Internet traffic usage of their fixed-wireless highspeed connection in near-real time. Network Operations team also utilize these data/graphs to troubleshoot various issues including link utilizations, inteference and link-faults. Historical traffic data is used to build several prediction and regression analysis models to utilize in traffic engineering, infrastructure planning and troubleshooting. A near-realtime visual representation of traffic utilization of wireless links is developedÂ using Javascript, D3, Django & Python. Data used in this work is extracted from customer premises devices (CPU) in near-realtime to produce more realistic results. The following software and frameworks are used to complete the project.

Python
MySQL
Django
Scikit-Learn
JavaScript
D3
Apache Web Server


RF Property Monitor

RF Property Monitor provides valuable stats related to wireless radio links operating in both licensed and unlicensed frequencies. The project comprises of multiple sub-tasks pipelined together to exchange data between them. SNMP and low-level programming methods are used to retrieve wireless data from 1000+ nodes in near-realtime. Formatted data is fed into Django for real-time processing and a web interface is developed to produce graphical interpretation of the findings. The processed data is stored in a structured database for prediction modeling, troubleshooting, infrustructure maintenance and regression analysis. Similar to the previous project, Python, MySQL, Django, SciKit-Learn, Javascript and D3 are used to develop the project.
